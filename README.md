# Generating Fake Celebrity Images using GAN

## Introduction
In this project, we leveraged the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) algorithm to generate fake celebrity images. The objective was to train a model that can generate realistic-looking images resembling celebrities. We employed a dataset containing images of celebrities, resized them to a dimension of 64x64, and normalized the pixel values to have a mean and standard deviation of 0.5, which is convenient for training purposes.

## Model Architecture
The GAN architecture consists of two main components: the Discriminator and the Generator.

### Discriminator
- The Discriminator is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to differentiate between real and fake images.
- It is trained to classify input images as either real or fake.
- We used a CNN with a stride of 2 to reduce the output feature map size.
- The Discriminator receives both real images from the dataset and fake images generated by the Generator as input during training.
- It calculates the loss using binary cross-entropy, aiming to output 1 for real images and 0 for generated images.
- We used the Adam optimizer to perform gradient descent during training.

### Generator
- The Generator takes a matrix of random noise with shape (128, 1, 1) and converts it into an image with shape (3, 64, 64).
- This random noise serves as a seed for generating fake images.
- The Generator's objective is to produce fake images that are realistic enough to fool the Discriminator.
- It also uses the Adam optimizer for gradient descent during training.

## Training and Results
- During training, the Discriminator was able to easily distinguish between fake and real images, achieving a maximum real score of 0.999 and a minimum fake score of 0.004100.
- The minimum loss of the Discriminator was 1.32764.
- However, the Generator struggled with generating realistic fake images, with a minimum loss of 1.32764.
- Future work will focus on improving the model to generate more realistic fake images based on the dataset.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrated the use of GANs for generating fake celebrity images. While the Discriminator was successful in distinguishing between real and fake images, the Generator requires further improvement to generate more realistic-looking images. With continued refinement and training, we aim to enhance the model's ability to produce high-quality fake images that closely resemble celebrities in the dataset.
